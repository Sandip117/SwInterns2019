	-Improper documentation, improper variable names, unused variables, compatibility issues/version conflicts in external APIs.

	6.	Tell us about the people who've influenced your programming.
	- When I was working for TCS, during my early days in the company I used to have a mentor, Brian, who was a contractor  
	working as the chief application architect . All the codes I used to write was reviewed by him as a part of  
	IQA process. His initial view towards my code was ?overly complex? and it was Brian who later on taught me most of the  
	hacks in .NET. The way he took every task as a challenge really motivated me to think differently for any given problem.

	7.	Tell us why you think you'd make an awesome addition to our team.
	- The fact that I have already worked with SolidWorks and know a lot of its internal processes would really save the   
	existing team a lot of efforts in trainings undoubtedly. Besides, my previous work experience and my academic standing   
	also will make me a more comfortable and calm resource than others. Lastly, I am friendly and have a good sense of humor  
	which can take me a long way with my teammates .
